**Cool Timeline** is an advanced WordPress plugin that helps you easily create timelines for your website. You can use it to display your **company’s history, product roadmaps, personal stories**, or key events in a vertical layout.

## Using Cool Timeline, you can create timeline stories in two ways:
1. **Gutenberg Timeline Block:** Add and manage timeline stories easily using the built-in block in the WordPress editor. Great for showing steps, events, or roadmaps with a clean design.
