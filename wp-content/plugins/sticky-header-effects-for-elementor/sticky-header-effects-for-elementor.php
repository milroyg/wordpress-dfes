/*
 * POSIMYTH Analytics SDK — registered, not required.
 *
 * Direct requires behind class_exists guards would mean whichever POSIMYTH plugin loaded FIRST
 * supplied the shared classes to every sibling, so an outdated plugin could silently downgrade the
 * whole suite. Each plugin registers its bundled copy instead, and the loader requires the NEWEST one
 * at plugins_loaded priority 0. The SHE subclass loads inside the consumer callback below, after the
 * winning copy exists.
 *
 * Registered here at the top of the file rather than inside she_header_load_plugin(), which returns
 * early when Elementor is missing or too old. Reporting must not depend on Elementor: an install
 * sitting there with Elementor deactivated is exactly the install support wants to see in the hub.
 *
 * The shared files are The Plus Addons for Elementor's copy with the text domain changed to
 * she-header and one addition (see includes/posimyth-sdk/version.php). Keep the bundled version.php
 * ahead of the siblings' or an older copy wins the loader.

/**
 * White label: a rebranded install must never surface POSIMYTH-branded UI AND must never phone
 * api.posimyth.com.
 *
 * Testable BEFORE the tracker boots — that ordering is the whole point. In an earlier sibling
 * integration this check sat below the tracker's init(), which hid the UI but left the activate /
 * deactivate / heartbeat pings running on a rebranded site whose consent was already on.
 *
 * The free build ships no white-label screen, so on a plain install this always returns false and
 * costs one option read. It exists because Sticky Header Effects Pro can rebrand, and because the
 * gate has to be in place before that arrives rather than retrofitted afterwards. Two contracts:
 *
 *  - `she_white_label` — an array written by Pro's white-label screen. Only the REBRANDING fields
 *    count. That distinction matters: The Plus Addons for Elementor stores plain UI preferences
 *    ("hide help links", "hide news") in the same option as its rebranding fields, and treating any
 *    non-empty value as rebranding meant a user who merely hid help links silently lost the tracker,
 *    the consent notice and the deactivation survey with nothing to indicate why. Add a new
 *    rebranding field to that screen and it must be added here too.
 *  - `she_posimyth_white_label` — a filter, for a Pro build that stores its rebranding somewhere
 *    other than that option. Returning true suppresses everything below.
 *
 * No Pro-constant gate: the stored values are the evidence and they outlive Pro, so deactivating Pro
 * on a rebranded install must not bring POSIMYTH branding back or resume the pings.

	 * quietly dropped to the SDK's generic seven reasons with no logo. That directory is also a synced

 * paint themselves correctly before this function runs. What is left here is a safety net plus the
 * handful of dialog details the survey exposes no key for.
 *
 * Worth keeping because that config key has gone missing once already: the re-sync to SDK 2.15.0 dropped
 * `css_prefix` outright and the notice reverted to a sibling's prefix and blue accent in total silence —
 * an unrecognised config key does nothing and nothing errors. These rules are anchored to OUR notice id
 * and OUR dialog id, so an id outranks the SDK's class-only rules and no sibling product's notice on the
 * same screen is affected either way. That isolation matters more since SDK 2.19.0, because the SDK now
 * emits ONE stylesheet for every active product and only the inline property varies.
 *
 * The selectors name only `posi-*` classes, which every product emits identically and no config key can
 * change, so a future sync cannot silently stop them matching the way the old `she-*` selectors could.
 * If `accent` is ever dropped again, the SDK falls back to its neutral and these rules still repaint
 * this plugin's notice. Check this function whenever includes/posimyth-sdk/ is re-synced.
 *
 * Priority 11: the SDK attaches its own inline CSS at the default 10 on the same `wp-admin` handle,
